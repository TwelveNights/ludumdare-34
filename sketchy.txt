The water collection system somehow manages to stay intact, with the help of a few minor repairs from time to time. Aside from that, I have enough electricity to kill off boredom and enough instant noodles to live comfortably, hehehe. The robot is finally complete, and I'll try to update as much as possible.");

I'll head out today to explore and see if I can find anything cool today as well. There are a few blueprints I found in my grandpa's basement that seem to be different ways to upgrade the robot, so I'll also look at them today. I have more to say but I really need to go to the bathroom right now, so maybe some other time...");

For starters, harvesting resources to repair my house from time to time would be nice. Just last week a storm nearly killed my water collector. Having another one wouldn't hurt, but that would take me aaages to finish building. For the time being, I'll have to rely on just the one. Hopefully things get easier just by having this robot around. It took me an hour just to turn it on today, since I was so scared that some stupid bug would kill the poor robot, but it looks good to go! Implementing vision was a success, and following these blueprints have really helped me out!");
